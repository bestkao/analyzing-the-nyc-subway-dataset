    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.
    
    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    Documentation about numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() below:

    '''
    
    # your code here
    sq_data_predictions_diff = np.sum((data - predictions)**2)
    mean = np.mean(data)
    sq_data_mean_diff = np.sum((data - mean)**2)

    r_squared = 1 - sq_data_predictions_diff / sq_data_mean_diff
    
    return r_squared
